## Topics Covered

- **Express.js** for building the backend server
- **MVC Architecture** for clean code organization
- **REST API** principles for resource-based communication
- **JWT Token Authentication** for secure login and protected routes
- **Logger** integration for debugging and monitoring
- **Database**: MongoDB using **Mongoose** ORM
- **Request-Response Lifecycle** understanding
- **Node.js Best Practices**:
  - Code Hygiene
  - Proper Commenting
  - File Structure
- **API Testing** using Postman
- **API Documentation** using Swagger UI
